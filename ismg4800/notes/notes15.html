<h1>Publishing &amp; Maintaining Your Web Site</h1>
<h2><span>Choosing a Web Server</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Web servers allow you to serve content over the Internet using the Hyper
    Text Markup Language (HTML).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The Web server accepts requests from browsers like Netscape and Internet
    Explorer and then returns the appropriate HTML documents.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>A number of server-side technologies can be used to increase the power of
    the server beyond its ability to deliver standard HTML pages; these include
    CGI scripts, server-side includes, SSL security, and Active Server Pages (ASPs).</li>
  <li><a name="3"></a>The Web server you choose will depend on the amount of traffic you expect
    your site to generate and on the &quot;extra&quot; server-side technologies
    you need your server to support.</li>
  <li>There are many, many Web servers to choose from:<font face="ARIAL, HELVETICA" size="-1">

<h2><span><a name="4"></a>Web Server Operating Systems</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>There's so much emphasis placed on specific applications that we tend to
    forget the engines that drive them: operating systems and platforms.&nbsp;</li>
  <li> When
    evaluating performance, you need to look at both the Web Server application
    and the
    operating system.&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li> A fast Web server on a slow OS will still be slow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="5"></a>Some basic operating systems Web Servers are used with are:
    <ul>
      <li>Commercial Unix (Sun Solaris)</li>
      <li>Open Source Unix (Open Linux, Open BSD)</li>
      <li>Windows (NT and 2000)</li>
      <li>Macintosh (Mac OS X)</li>
      <li>Novell NetWare</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All of these operating systems got pretty good ratings from <a href="http://serverwatch.internet.com/platforms.html">Web
    Server Compare</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1><a name="6"></a>Choosing an Internet Service Provider</h1>
<ul>
  <li>If your company or organization is not large enough or does not want to
    maintain their own Web server then you need to select an Internet Service
    Provider (ISP) to host your Web site.</li>
  <li>Even if you are maintaining your own Web Server you still will need to get
    it connected to the Internet (so some of the ISP issues are relevant).</li>
  <li>The following are some of the features you should look for when shopping
    for an ISP:</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><span><a name="7"></a>Easy Connection</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Choose an ISP that allows you to easily connect to their
    service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>For smaller sites you will want to be able to connect using a local phone
    call.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>The provider should have enough Points of Presence (POPs) to make
        dialing easy.</li>
      <li>You should never get a busy signal when you dial your ISP - if you do
        change ISPs.</li>
      <li>Try to match the size of the ISP to the size of the company.&nbsp; A
        local company does not need a national ISP.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="8"></a>For larger sites you may need a faster connection to the internet or one
    that supports more users.&nbsp; You have a few options - each depends on
    local availablitiy:
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#0000FF"><b>ISDN</b></font> stands for Integrated Services Digital Network.&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li>The top speed of an ISDN line is 128k/s in both directions.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>ISDN is a dial-up service like traditional modems.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0000FF"><b>Cable modems</b></font> are devices that gives internet connectivity through a
        cable television connection.&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li>A cable modem can provide connection speeds of anywhere from
            500K/second to 20+Mb/second.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>A cable modem provides &quot;always on&quot; service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          <li>A single cable modem can also be shared (via a network server)
            among multiple computers, providing simultaneous Internet access for
            a small network.</li>
          <li><a name="9"></a>Cable is a shared network, when too many users on one line try to
            share the same cable, performance can suffer dramatically.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Cable customers are forbidden to telecommute, host web sites, use
            video teleconferencing and many other bandwidth intensive
            applications.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>There are also certain security risks which can make users more
            vulnerable to data interception, unauthorized monitoring and hacking
            from other users along the same cable network.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#0000FF"><b><a name="10"></a>DSL</b></font>, or Digital Subscriber Line, is another option for faster internet
        connections.&nbsp;
        <ul>
          <li>Commonly, the affordable DSL solutions for go up to 2-3 Mb/second
            at the most.</li>
          <li>DSL provides &quot;always on&quot; service.</li>
          <li>DSL provides a dedicated line to each subscriber, making it more
            appropriate for businesses than cable modems.</li>
          <li>There are rarely restrictions on DSL customers using bandwidth
            intensive applications.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><span><a name="11"></a>Accessible Technical Support</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Technical support is an absolute necessity! Make sure your ISP has
    competent, accessible customer service.</li>
  <li>Call potential ISPs and talk with someone in customer service.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>Tell them what you hope to accomplish (such as set-up a Web site, run
        ASP etc.) and how experienced you are and see how helpful they are.</li>
      <li>Time how long they keep you on hold when you are waiting to talk to
        customer service.</li>
      <li>Local ISPs may not have a large staff but they also have fewer
        subscribers - National ISPs have so much volume they may keep you
        waiting an unacceptable length of time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><span><a name="12"></a>Additional E-mail Addresses</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>All access accounts come with at least one email address.&nbsp; If you are
    part of a group you may want additional addresses for your organization.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><span>&nbsp;Personal vs. Commercial Accounts</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Personal ISP accounts generally are less expensive than a business
    account.&nbsp; You have less disk space, fewer features and a more complex
    URL.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>Businesses generally will want more services than those provided with
        personal ISP accounts when establishing a commercial Web site.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Commercial ISP accounts usually provide extra services including:
    <ul>
      <li><b><font color="#0000FF">SQL Database Support</font>:</b> There are several products (e.g. ASP or
        Cold Fusion) that allow databases to be connected to the Web.&nbsp; A
        commercial ISP account should support/allow some type of SQL Database
        connectivity.</li>
      <li><b><font color="#0000FF">Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Support</font>:</b>&nbsp; SSL is an Internet
        communications protocol that allows encrypted transmission of data
        between the user and the server.&nbsp; SSL is necessary if you are going
        to take orders via the Web or transmit other types of sensitive data.</li>
      <li><b><font color="#0000FF">Shopping Cart Hosting</font></b>: Some ISPs/external companies will also
        host your shopping cart. This includes taking secure orders, maintaining
        credit card information in a secure database, submitting payments to
        the&nbsp; credit card companies etc.</li>
      <li><b><font color="#0000FF">Multimedia Capabilities</font></b>: Some ISPs will support the streaming
        of multimedia.&nbsp; Streaming is a server based technology that
        transmits audio or video in a continuous stream&nbsp; so it can be
        played while it is still downloading.&nbsp;</li>
      <li><b><font color="#0000FF">CGI Script Capabilities</font></b>: You will want your ISP to allow you to
        use CGI scripts on you Web site.&nbsp; You will need to find out if you
        will be allowed to create your own CGIs, whether your CGIs can be put in
        your own Web spece or if they will need to go in the cgi-bin directory,
        or if the ISP has generic CGIs that you can use (e.g. to mail forms).</li>
      <li><b><font color="#0000FF">Activity Reporting</font></b>: Most Web servers can track how often users
        visit your site, which pages are requested most often, and how your Web
        site traffic varies from month to month.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<hr>


<h1>Buying A Domain Name</h1>
<ul>
  <li>When establishing a commercial Web site you will usually want to get a
    domain name for your site (mycompany.com).</li>
  <li>If you want to&nbsp; see if a domain name is available , or to register
    your own domain name, visit <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com">Network
    Solutions</a>.</li>
  <li>For an additional fee your ISP can register your domain name for
    you.&nbsp; Registration requires a valid name and the servers primary and
    secondary IP addresses.</li>
  <li>Domain names need to be renewed every two to five years.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<script language="JavaScript">writeFooter(0);</script>

<h1>Web Site Testing</h1>
<h2><span>Why Test?</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Whenever someone visits your Web site, they judge your company.</li>
  <li>A site that is fast, informative and easy to use adds real value to your 
  brand. What's more, it will generate repeat visits, new business, valuable 
  referrals and positive PR.</li>
  <li>But you don't know who the visitors will be. They won't always be using 
  the most popular or most recent computer systems, browsers or plug-ins, for 
  example. Some combinations may cause problems. Your visitors may be 
  experienced Web surfers, or they may not. Some will connect through high-speed 
  networks, perhaps with firewalls and content filters, and others will have 
  slow dial up connections. 8% of your male visitors will be color blind. </li>
  <li>Your aim should be to cater to everyone. So how can you make sure your 
  site really works?</li>
  <li>You can't rely on your customers to take the time to report any hidden 
  problems with your site - they'll simply click and go.</li>
  <li>You need a more scientific approach. </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><span>User Experience Testing</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>People have short attention spans and the Web gives them plenty of choice.</li>
  <li>You should test that your site can be used by your untrained customers 
  without assistance.
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that functionality has appropriate depth, pages operate as expected 
  and help is available when required.<br>
  </li>
  </ul>

<h4>User Testing</h4>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#0000FF">Test with a variety of users</font> from your target audience to get their
    feedback on your Web site.&nbsp; Get subjects with:
    <ul>
      <li>A variety of backgrounds</li>
      <li>Different computer skill levels</li>
      <li>Different familiarity with the material / products</li>
      <li>Avoid friends as testers because they may not be objective</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If possible, watch users interact with your site to see where they might
    have difficulty navigating / using your site.</li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF">Formalize your testing</font> by creating replicable methods of testing your
    site.&nbsp; This lets you compare results across users and assess
    improvements as you refine the site.
    <ul>
      <li>Prepare a series of questions to ask users after viewing the site</li>
      <li>Give them a specific task to complete or have them find a specific
        piece of information then have them rate the ease or complexity of
        completing the task.&nbsp; You can also time how long it takes them to
        complete the task.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF">Develop a Feedback form</font> that users can fill out after testing the site (it
    can be online too).&nbsp; Include a set of criteria and let them rate the
    site on a progressive scale (1-5).&nbsp; Questions could include:
    <ul>
      <li>Did you find the information you needed?</li>
      <li>Was it easy or difficult to access the information you needed?</li>
      <li>Did you find the Web site visually attractive?</li>
      <li>Did you find the content easy to read?</li>
      <li>Did you find the Web site easy to navigate?</li>
      <li>Did you think the information was presented correctly?</li>
      <li>Did the information have enough depth?</li>
      <li>What area of the Web site did you like best? Why?</li>
      <li>What area of the Web site did you like least? Why?</li>
      <li>Would you recommend the Web site to others?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><span>Content Testing</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Maintain the quality of your content - not only do links go bad, other
    information can become obsolete or incorrect.</li>
  <li>Periodically check you content to make sure it still makes
    sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>Are your prices competitive?</li>
      <li>Are you referring to old versions or obsolete products?</li>
      <li>Is your corporate information up to date?
        </li>
      <li>Are you using an old/obsolete technology to provide the information?</li>
      <li>Are your images or color scheme dated?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Poorly maintained content can degrade your organizations image.&nbsp;
    Costing you visitors, customers, and investors.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h2><span>Usability Testing</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Usability testing is done to ensure you do not lose customers because 
    they find your site hard to use. </li>
    <li>Usability can be thought of as a measure of how simple it is for the visitor 
to complete the sequence of steps necessary to accomplish any given task. The 
smaller the number of steps and the more intuitive each step is, the more usable 
that function of the web site is. </li>
    <li>Usability of a Web Site is determined by user satisfaction and ease of 
navigation. A user shouldn't have to remember the sites organization or 
functionalities. The goal is user effectiveness and efficiency with a minimal 
likelihood of errors while performing the tasks the site has been designed for; 
finding information needed or completing an e-commerce transaction. </li>
    <li>Usability is very much like quality: you perceive it mainly when it is missing. 
    </li>
    <li>Categorically, sites score poorly in: 
    <ul>
      <li>consistency of presentation and controls across the site </li>
      <li>natural organization of information: clear structure, systematic identification, 
clear and meaningful labels <br>
contextual navigation, in terms of how much information is given for providing a 
context to the user: where is s/he? where can s/he go? how can s/he go back? 
      </li>
      <li>efficient navigation, in terms of time and effort the user needs to move around 
the site <br>
adequacy of feedback in displaying the effects of some command, in answering to 
requests <br>
search ability, or how effectively the site content can be sought in search 
engines </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
<hr>
<h2><span>Accessibility</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Making your web pages accessible is not only a good idea, but it's good for 
  business.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.adaaccessnow.org/home.htm">Access Now, Inc.</a> and 
  Robert Gumson have
  <a href="http://www.law.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/View&c=LawArticle&cid=1032128683422&t=LawArticleTech">
  sued Southwest and American airlines</a> because
  <a href="http://www.southwest.com/">Southwest's site</a> is allegedly 
  &quot;inaccessible&quot;. This isn't the first time something like this happened, 
  either. In 1999, the <a href="http://www.nfb.org/">National Federation of the 
  Blind</a> filed a <a href="http://www.nfb.org/bm/bm99/bm991201.htm">lawsuit 
  against AOL</a> because AOL's internet services were inaccessible. Over the 
  past two years, Access Now has also sued <a href="http://www.bn.com/">Barnes &amp; 
  Noble</a> and <a href="http://www.claires.com/index.asp">claire's</a> because 
  their sites were inaccessible.</li>
  <li>The first thing to do to improve Web site accessibility is to use the
  <strong style="font-weight: 400">ALT attribute for images that convey 
  information.</strong> While ALT attributes aren't necessary for spacer images 
  or purely ornamental images, ALT attributes are <em>essential</em> for
  <strong style="font-weight: 400"><em>all</em></strong> images that convey 
  content. The text in an ALT attributes describes to users of non-graphical 
  browsers (including screen readers) what information is displayed by the 
  image.</li>
  <li>For accessibility purposes, people who create forms may need to add extra 
  markup to help screen readers translate a visually-based association of a text 
  label (like a question or description) and its form input field into a literal 
  association of these elements.
  <ul>
    <li>For example:Enclose the question or description associated with a form 
    field in a &lt;label for=&quot;&quot;&gt; tag. Then, add an ID attribute to the input field 
    and make both the ID and FOR equal to the same value.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><code>&lt;label for=&quot;firstName&quot;&gt;First Name&lt;/label&gt;<br>
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;fName&quot; id=&quot;firstName&quot; size=&quot;10&quot; maxlength=&quot;20&quot; 
  value=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; </code>
  <ul>
    <li>If the form elements are laid out correctly on a page by using tables or 
    CSS, adding that extra markup isn't as important. What's important is that 
    the users know what the question or description is for a form's field 
    immediately before they're prompted to enter a response. </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Obeying other basic Usability rules also helps improve Web site 
  Accessibility</li>

<h2><span>Functionality Testing</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Functionality testing services to ensure that 
your web site or web application functions as it is designed to. </li>
  <li>Functionality testing ensures that the primary features of your site 
  function properly</li>
  <li>Simple functional tests include things like link 
verification. </li>
  <li>More in-depth functional tests include things like validation of 
  databases, forms, and other interactive features. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Link / Image Testing</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure all links (including those to external cascading style sheet or JavaScript
    files) are fully functional.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Test your links immediately after you upload and regularly thereafter
    (monthly?)</li>
  <li>There are some Web robots, spiders, snakes or crawlers that will search
    you Web site to make sure all your links are valid (they do not check to see
    if the content has changed).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><span>Compatibility Testing</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>With all of the different browsers and operating systems on the market today, it 
is crucial to verify that your web site or web application functions properly 
across a wide range of platforms. </li>
  <li>By testing your web application on different 
browsers and operating systems, you can ensure that certain coding such as Java 
Applets, Active X Controls, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML function properly across 
multiple configurations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Test in as many different environments as possible, including:</li>
  <li><b><font color="#0000FF">Multiple browsers and versions</font></b>:&nbsp; 
  Don't just test the current version of Internet Explorer and Navigator, test 
  older versions too.</li>
  <li><b><font color="#0000FF">Multiple Operating Systems</font></b>: Test on 
  PCs, Macintosh, and Unix Systems.</li>
  <li><b><font color="#0000FF">Connection Speeds</font></b>: Test for a variety 
  of connection speeds. Got to a friends house, library or Internet cafe and 
  test from there.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.wirednews.com">Wired 
  news</a>, 33% of Web users will leave a Web site if it takes longer than 8 
  seconds to load.</li>
  <li><b><font color="#0000FF">Display Types</font></b>: Test using different 
  screen sizes, screen resolutions and color depths to make sure your 
  site/colors display well at each setting.</li>

<h2><span>Performance Testing</span></h2>
<ul>
  <li>FACT: 46% of 
users have been driven to alternative sites because their preferred site was 
unavailable.</li>
  <li>The results of tests conducted by a leading provider of Web performance 
solutions showed that 98% of Web sites have a critical problem with scalability.</li>
  <li>Sites  tested for performance are able to cope with on average only 15% of 
  their expected capacity.</li>
  <li>Performance testing determines:<ul>
  <li>How many simultaneous users the web site can support </li>
  <li>How many simultaneous transactions the web site can support </li>
  <li>Page load times under various traffic conditions </li>
  <li>Where bottlenecks are occurring </li>

<h1>Attracting Notice to Your Web Site&nbsp;</h1>
<ul>
  <li>With millions of pages on the Web it can be difficult to get your Web site
    noticed.</li>
  <li>Know your target audience and publicize your URL as much as possible where
    your target audience is likely to see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Include your URL as much as possible in other mediums: business cards,
    letterheads, catalogs, mailings, advertisements&nbsp; . . .</li>
  <li>Give users a reason to visit your Web site by giving them something they
    can not get in other mediums (e.g. up-to-the-minute pricing or technical
    information).</li>

<h2><span>Search Engine Placement</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
  <p>If Google can't find you, then you don't exist.</p>
    </li>
    <li>You can lose customers before they even get to your site.</li>
    <li>It is now widely accepted that if you are not listed in the first 3 pages of 
results from a search engine then you will not be found by that potential 
customer. </li>
    <li>The majority of people will simply go to a competitor's site that does appear 
in those results or try new search criteria assuming that they have failed to 
find what they are looking for. </li>
  </ul>
<ul>
  <li><em>Before</em> you register your Web site with a Search Engine you should
    enhance your Web site to make sure it displays well within Search Engine
    results.</li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF">Use Meaningful Titles</font>: All pages on your Web site need meaningful
    titles.&nbsp; Some search engines read only the title when indexing the Web
    site.&nbsp; The title is also what shows up in a user's favorites or
    bookmark list.</li>
  <li><font color="#0000FF">Use &lt;META&gt; elements</font>:&nbsp; You can use META elements to raise on
    your Web site listing with certain search engines.&nbsp; AltaVista, Excite,
    Inktomi and HotBot use them but some other search engines ignore them.&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li><a name="26"></a>&lt;META&gt; Elements go in the &lt;HEAD&gt; section of the document
        and let you specify information about the document that is invisible to
        the user.</li>
      <li>Common &lt;META&gt; elements are Author, Description, Keywords and
        Generator.</li>
