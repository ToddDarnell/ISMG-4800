      <span>
    <ul>
      <li>When you send the AJAX request, you provide the name of 
    a JavaScript function that handles the response. <br>
      <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http_request.onreadystatechange = nameOfTheFunction;</code> <br>
      This function needs to check for the state of the request. </li>
      <li>The full list of the <code>readyState</code> values is as follows:
      <center>
      <table border="0" width=50% cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" >
        <tr valign=top><td align=left width="50%"><font size="2">0 (uninitialized)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          1 (loading) <br>
          2 (loaded) </font>
          </td>
          <td width="50%" ><span><font size="2">3 (interactive) <br>
          4 (complete) </font>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table></center>
      If the state has the value of 4, that means that the full server response 
is received and it&#39;s OK for you to continue processing it.
</li>
    </ul>
    <div><pre>if (http_request.readyState == 4) {
    <dfn>// everything is good, the response is received
    // so do something</dfn>
} 
</pre></div>
