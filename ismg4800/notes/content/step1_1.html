      <ul>
      <li>The next thing is to decide what you want to do after you receive the 
    server response to your request. At this stage you just need to tell the 
    HTTP request object which JavaScript function will do the work of processing 
    the response. This is done by setting the <code>onreadystatechange</code> 
    property of the object to the name of the JavaScript function you plan to 
    use, like this: </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
    <p><code>http_request.onreadystatechange = nameOfTheFunction;</code> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Note that there are no brackets after the function name and no parameters 
    passed. Also, instead of giving a function name, you can use the JavaScript 
    technique of defining functions on the fly and define the actions that will 
    process the response right away, like this: </li>
    </ul>
    <div><pre>http_request.onreadystatechange = function(){
    <dfn>// do the thing</dfn>
};</pre></div>
