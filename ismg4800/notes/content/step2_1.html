    <ul>
      <li>The next thing to check is the status code of the HTTP server response. 
    All the possible codes are listed on the
    <a class="external text" title="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" rel="nofollow">
    W3C site</a>. For our purposes we are only interested in <code>200 OK</code> 
    response. </li>
    </ul>
    <div><pre>if (http_request.status == 200) {
    <dfn>// perfect!</dfn>
} else {
    <dfn>// The response may be a 404 (Not Found)
    // or 500 (Internal Server Error) response codes</dfn>
}
</pre></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Now after you've checked the state of the request and the HTTP status 
    code of the response, it's up to you to do whatever you want with the data 
    the server has sent to you. You have two options to access that data: 
      <ul>
        <li><code>http_request.responseText</code> – will return the server 
      response as a string of text </li>
        <li><code>http_request.responseXML</code> – will return the response as an
      <code>XMLDocument</code> object you can traverse using the JavaScript DOM 
      functions </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
