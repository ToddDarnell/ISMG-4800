      <ul>
      <li>Next, after you've declared what will happen as soon as you receive the 
    response, you need to actually make the request. You need to call the <code>
    open()</code> and <code>send()</code> methods of the HTTP request class, 
    like this: </li>
    </ul>
    <div><pre>http_request.open('GET', 'http://www.example.org/some.file', true);
http_request.send(null);
</pre></div>
    <ul>
      <li>The first parameter of the call to <code>open()</code> is the HTTP 
      request method – (e.g. GET or POST). Keep the method capitalized as per the 
      HTTP standard; otherwise some browsers (like Firefox) might not process 
      the request. </li>
      <li>The second parameter is the URL of the page you're requesting. As a 
      security feature, you cannot call pages on 3rd-party domains. Be sure to 
      use the exact domain name on all of your pages or you will get a 
      'permission denied' error when you call open(). </li>
      <li>The third parameter sets whether the request is asynchronous. If <code>
      TRUE</code>, the execution of the JavaScript function will continue while 
      the response of the server has not yet arrived. This is the A in AJAX.
      </li>
    </ul>
