<ul><li>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a new term for two powerful browser features that have been around for years, but were overlooked by many web developers until recently when applications such as Gmail, <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en">Google Suggest</a>, and <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> hit the streets.</li>
<li>The two features that make AJAX a new way to look at Web design are that you can:
<ul>
  <li>Make requests to the server without reloading the page </li>
  <li>Parse and work with XML documents </li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
