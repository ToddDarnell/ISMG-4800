<h2>
Heading 2- Normal no CSS set</h2>

<p>
Paragraph with font-face:Arial, font-size:14 and font-color:blue.&nbsp; It 
contains
<strong>
strong text. The strong text is green with a light green background.&nbsp; The 
text is also Arial &amp; 14pt because the &lt;strong&gt; tag is inside the &lt;p&gt; with those 
properties.&nbsp; &lt;strong&gt; text is also BOLD because by default &lt;strong&gt; is bold 
and we did not reset that with our style sheet...
</strong> After the closing &lt;/strong&gt; tag this text is not green or bold...

<p>In this paragraph some &lt;em&gt; text starts here:
<em> &lt;em&gt; text is red and italic because italic is the default for the &lt;em&gt; tag.&nbsp; 
The &lt;em&gt; text is larger than the &lt;p&gt; it is in even though both font-sizes are 
set to 1.17em;&nbsp; The &quot;em&quot; size attribute is a relative size to what the text 
would be without the size setting.&nbsp; Thus this text is 1.17*1.17 larger than 
the default. </em>&nbsp;The paragraph can continue after the &lt;/em&gt; tag. Note --- 
the em size specification is completely different from the &lt;em&gt; tag which stands 
for emphasis.</p>
 
<p><strong>This paragraph started with the &lt;strong&gt; tag then has:<em> &lt;em&gt;
 text here </em> The em style does not reset the background-color or the 
font-weight so &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; text appears
on the green background and is 
bold.&nbsp;</strong> The Strong tag ended here so&nbsp; you get 
the blue paragraph text for the remainder of the paragraph...</body></html>
