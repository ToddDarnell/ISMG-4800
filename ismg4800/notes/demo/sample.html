  <H2>Introduction</H2>
  <P>What are the essential traits of great Web sites? After you visit a site 
  and find yourself staying awhile, what makes you stay? A sense of humor helps. 
  Flashy graphics are nice. But the fundamental traits that make a site work are 
  more elusive. This article will break down the essential characteristics of 
  great Web sites into some easily followed rules of thumb.</P>
  <P>Most of these guidelines are just plain common sense, which seems to be a 
  scarce commodity on the Web. The sexy proprietary page-layout and text markup 
  features provided by Netscape and Explorer as they leapfrog each other have 
  seduced many a webmaster into jazzing up their pages, only to be forced to put 
  "you must use Netscape/Explorer to view these pages" at the bottom. This could 
  be rephrased to say "these pages look awful without Netscape or Explorer." 
  Stick with standard HTML (currently HTML 4) (<A href="#1">1</A>) and your pages will 
  look good on all browsers that support it.</P>
  <P>Overall, we've found that companies either get the Web or they don't. Your 
  Web site should reflect the culture of the Web, which we call the "Gift 
  Economy." (witness Netscape and Microsoft) Very few sites (5%) can charge for 
  admission or require membership, and many people avoid sites with these 
  barriers. Give away something valuable: information, software, advice, humor, 
  and people will flock to your site.</P>
  <A name=guidelines></A>
  <H2>Site Guidelines</H2>
  <P>Here are the Web site guidelines that we follow at <A href="http://www.internet.com/">internet.com</A>.</P>
  <A name=great></A>
      <H3>Provide credible, original content in as many forms 
      as possible.</H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><P>Original content is the most important trait of a great Web site. 
      Sites that provide only links to other sites are essentially meta-lists 
      (although Yahoo seems to be doing well :), while sites that have some 
      information that's useful to the user stand out and will be revisited.&nbsp;</p>
      </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Provide valuable, timely information to the user, not 
      lots of data. 
      </H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Web sites should be updated regularly. Stale Web 
      sites say "been there, done that." For the information to be valuable it 
      should be well-edited. For external links include only 
      the best sites with concise descriptions. For internal content be like a 
      magazine editor, don't rush to publish mediocre or incomplete articles. 
      Typos are unacceptible. [sic]
      </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Share everything you learn 
      </H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Great Web sites share everything they learn and hear (that's relevant 
      of course) with their users. Give behind the scenes accounts of your 
      latest site features, go open source, start a newsletter, and you'll get 
      more than you give. 
    
      </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Custom-tailor the information to user preferences. 
      </H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>One of the Web's strengths is the volume of information available. 
      That is also one of its weaknesses. Sites that offer customization 
      features (<A href="http://www.nu2.com/">What's New Too</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.mylook.com/">Mylook</A>, <A 
      href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot.org</A>) allow the user to filter 
      the content they see. The future of the Web are "one-to-one" Web sites. 
      These automated, database-driven sites adapt the content, advertising, and 
      even the look to individual users. Technologies such as <A 
      href="http://www.apple.com/">Web Objects</A>,&nbsp; <A 
      href="http://www.allaire.com/">Cold Fusion</A>  and ASP allow webmasters to create 
      dynamic, interactive, and adaptive Web sites.
      </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Be responsive on a 56 Kbps modem (the typical Web 
      user). 
      </H3><BLOCKQUOTE><h4>Use graphics sparingly</h4>
    <P>Each graphic 
      takes another trip to the server. Consolidate neighboring graphics or use 
      CSS'd text or table cells with background colors to speed display. <A 
      href="http://www.webmonkey.com/">WebMonkey</A> has a policy "use graphics 
      for graphics and text for text, not graphic text." Size graphics to fit in 
      a typical user's window It's easy to see if a site's been designed on only a PC, the 
      page is too wide on a Mac.
      <h4>Break up your tables vertically</h4>
      <P>One huge table takes 
      much longer to display content than stacked smaller tables which display 
      one at a time.&nbsp; 
      <h4>Optimize graphic file size for Web display</h4>
    <P>Use a maximum of 20 KB 
      per graphic. Utilize page display speedups such as the WIDTH and HEIGHT 
      attributes for images. Use JPEGs where possible and appropriate 
      (continuous-toned images) and minimize the color palette of GIFs to <A 
      href="http://www.webreference.com/dev/graphics/">optimize file size</A>. 
      Provide text alternatives to graphics for low-bandwidth 
      users, the blind, and for speed. ALTernate text tags for images should be 
      functional, not descriptive.&nbsp; 
      <h4>Optimize your HTML&nbsp;</h4>
      <P>Removing excess spaces, comments, tags and 
      commentary, especially on your home page, to minimize file size and 
      download time. Products like Antimony Software's <A 
      href="http://www.antimonysoftware.com/">Mizer</A> and VSE's <A 
      href="http://www.vse-online.com/">HTML Turbo</A> automate this process by 
      removing excess characters and HTML to optimize your HTML and JavaScript. These products should be 
      used as the last step before you upload your page (the files are harder to 
      read after many of the returns are removed). After optimization your pages 
      will appear to snap onto the screen.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Be easy to read. 
      </H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Make your pages as easy to read as possible. Black text on a white 
      background (as this page is set up) is the easiest to read. I've seen some 
      nearly impossible to read pages that use backgrounds the same shade as the 
      text (dark text on a dark background and vice versa). If you use a 
      background, stick with the lighter shades and let the text stay black. Use 
      a wide and short (we use 700 X 16 pixels) background graphic that's 
      non-interlaced and under 1K or &lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"&gt;. HTML 4.0 
      now includes style sheets that can control page, link, and text color 
      attributes site-wide, and make maintenance easy.
  
    
      </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Be interactive; good interactivity engages the user 
      and makes your site memorable. 
      </H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>After original content, the second most important trait a Web site 
      should have is interactivity. The Web is an interactive hypermedia 
      communications medium that your Web site should reflect. Sites that 
      involve the user and have a sense of fun or adventure will get more hits, 
      and can charge more for ad space. 
      <P>Another advantage of interactivity is self-generating content. 
      By allowing your visitors to interact with your site they actually create 
      content for you. Script-driven user surveys and forums allow visitors to 
      share information with others and can help shape your site to better serve 
      their needs. Forum or chat software is a great way to do this. A great 
      example of a user-driven site is <A 
      href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A>, a news site for nerds which 
      posts short stories submitted by users, and allows users to easily append 
      comments to each story.</P>
      
  
    
      </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Be well-organized 
      </H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Balance the number of levels (the degree of hyperization) with page 
      length to minimize scrolling and display time. 
      <P><A href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</A> found that users 
      equate poor organization with poor site design in their extensive <A 
      href="http://www.sun.com/sun-on-net/uidesign/">usability study</A> of 
      their home page. They also found that users don't want to scroll. However, 
      the hits on <A href="http://www.discovery.com/">Discovery Channel 
      Online</A> increased by 40% after they went from non-scrolling design to a 
      scrolling design. It depends on your application. Designing pages so 
      important content is "above the fold" is a good idea, though some sites 
      take this maxim to an extreme and cram everything into a cramped mess. 
      Where possible, size your pages important content to fit into the typical 
      user's screen (465 pixels wide by 340 pixels high for a 15" monitor). Web 
      pages should be at most two 8.5 x 11 pages in length.&nbsp; 
      <P>Part of having a well-organized site is providing multiple ways of easy 
      navigation (<A href="http://www.webreference.com/greatsite.html#3">3</A>). 
      Supply both text and graphics for buttons. Users feel more comfortable if 
      you maintain a consistent look and feel throughout your site.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Use an appropriate metaphor (like Zima's fridge or <A 
      href="http://www.ragu.com/">Ragu's Mama Cuchino Kitchen</A>). 
      </H3><BLOCKQUOTE><P>Most good sites have a Logo that brands the site and
    appears on every page.&nbsp; Using a good graphic metaphor for your interface makes the user feel 
      more comfortable navigating your site. Good metaphors, like using a fridge 
      as a gateway to the world of Zima, can elevate a merely good site to a 
      great site.
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Match customer profiles with <A href="http://www.webreference.com/internet/statistics.html">Net 
      demographics</A> (now about <A href="http://www.cyberatlas.com/">50/50</A> educated males/females).
      </H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><P>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Fill a niche.</H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><P>Many sites on the Web are just lists that someone else has already 
        done.</Blockquote>
  
      <H3>Dominate a subject area; become the site for 
      that subject.</H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><P>Don't duplicate a list when you can point to it. Leverage 
      other people's work to reduce your workload. Let others who 
      specialize in a particular topic keep their list up to date for you. On 
      the other hand, don't make lists that point to lists ad infinitum, seek 
      out the meat of the site and point directly to the article or resource. 
      Many sites on the Web are just lists that someone else has already done.</BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Have a secure and automated server </H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE><P>Usage statistics, what's new, what's old (tours, outline), 
      autoresponders, bad URL checkers, and search engines are some of the tools 
      webmasters should utilize. 
      <H4>Tracking</H4>
      <P>Part of Web marketing is gauging the effect your pages have on the 
      public. Sophisticated site <A href="http://www.webreference.com/internet/software/usage.html">usage 
      tools</A> such as I/Count, SiteTrack, WebTrends, and Interse Market Focus 
      allow site developers and their clients to easily see the popularity of 
      different pages, stay duration, where they come from and where they go, 
      and even the path they take through your site. Include a what's new area 
      to give frequent visitors a way to see what has changed since their last 
      visit.</P>
      <H4>Automation</H4>
      <P>Maintaining a large Web site can be a daunting experience. Use 
      automation tools where possible for site maintenance. Use <A 
      href="http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/html/validation.html">local 
      spiders</A> such as MOMspider and LinkBot to help check for old URLs. 
      Where you choose to link will affect how fast your links will fail. The 
      deeper into a site you link, the more likely it is to change. Don't move 
      popular pages in your site unnecessarily, you'll break the links to your 
      pages. If you do move them, provide a "this page has moved" page. Many 
      orphaned links are a sign of webmaster neglect.</P>
      <H4>Searching</H4>
      <P>Let users search your site with search tools such as SWISH and <A 
      href="http://www.excite.com/">Excite</A> for Web Servers. Offer an 
      overview of your site with a TOC or <A 
      href="http://www.webreference.com/index2.html">site map</A>.</P>
      <P><A href="http://www.webreference.com/internet/security.html">Security</A>
      <P>Security is often the last item addressed on even larger commercial 
      sites. Allowing adventurous users to sniff around your files (especially 
      your server configuration files) is not a good policy, but amazingly only 
      20% of current Web sites are secure.</P>
   </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <A name=makeit></A>
  <H2>Build it, and they will come?</H2>
  <P>A common misconception companies new to the Web have is that if they put up 
  a page, people will visit it. In order to have a popular site, you've got to 
  offer something to the user: information, interactivity, fun, freebies, 
  something more than an 800 number.</P>
  <P>Original content is important. Users may come to your site once, but to 
  keep them coming back you've got to have fresh original content.</P>
  <P>Sites that offer freebees get noticed. Free software, services, databases 
  or electronic newsletters will attract users like a magnet. <A 
  href="http://www.sgi.com/">SGI</A> has a FREE LUNCH area where you can 
  download free software, computer games, graphics, and video.</P><A 
  name=conclusions></A>
  <H2>Conclusions</H2>
  <P>The Web is an interactive, dynamic, and rapidly changing new communications 
  medium that your Web site should reflect. Well-organized, edited, and timely 
  original content set in an attractive, interactive, and 
  consistent format are some traits of great Web sites.</P>
